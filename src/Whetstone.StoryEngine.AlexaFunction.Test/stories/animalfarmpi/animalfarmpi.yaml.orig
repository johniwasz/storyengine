Milfred may be a cat, but deep down she just doesn’t believe in violence – so she tried to startle you with an airhorn, but ended up scaring herself, dropped the airhorn and is now cowering under the couch with Ferb, her stinky mackerel.  You can pick up the airhorn or go to the garden.

Milfred may be a cat, but deep down she just doesn’t believe in violence – so she tried to startle you with an airhorn, but ended up scaring herself, dropped the airhorn and is now cowering under the couch with Ferb, her stinky mackerel.  You can pick up the airhorn or go to the garden.

Looks like he’s come down to the pond to feed the ducks.  He’s carrying a briefcase.  He pulls a loaf of bread out of the briefcase and sets the briefcase down.  The loaf of bread is in a plastic bag.  He takes the bread out of the bag and then throws the bag in a nearby wastebasket and starts feeding the ducks.  You’ll need bread to make your sandwich.  I bet he wouldn’t mind feeding a pig.
