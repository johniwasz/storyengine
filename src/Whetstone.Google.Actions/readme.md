The Google Action request/response classes were autogenerated based on JSON Schema made available here:

https://github.com/actions-on-google/assistant-conversation-schema

And the classes were autogenerated from this free online utility:

https://app.quicktype.io/?l=csharp

Manual changes to the autogenerated code include:

- Removal of the Action class as that just encapsulates the HandlerRequest and HandlerResponse messages.
- Applied MaxDepth = 30 to the internal JsonSerializerSettings since the NewtonSoft library has a vulnerability to deeply nested objects.
