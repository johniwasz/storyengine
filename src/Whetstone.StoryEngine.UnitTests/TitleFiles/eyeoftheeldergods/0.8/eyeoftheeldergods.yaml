        text: A sweeping flash of light engulfs the world, then silence.  The servitor creature is gone, as is any sign of Cthulhu.  All that remains is the charred and smoking heap of the painting and the dejected cultists.  You have managed to save the world, but you find out later that it has cost you your daughter's life.  Pohlhaus is ultimately convicted of her murder and sent to prison, but you are left grieving.  And Cthulhu is left to wait for another chance, when the stars are right again, to return to the world.
